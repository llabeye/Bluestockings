# Bluestockings
 Core Interaction 2020 Final Project
This is a fictional webpage trying to create an online counterpart of the zine bookstore Bluestockings Cafe in NYC.
As local businesses are struggling to sustain themselves due to COVID-19, I wanted to create a space where viewers could not only order from the store directly, but also create their own zines documenting their unique narratives during a global pandemic.
Credits to paper.js, moment.js and good ol' stackoverflow. 
Also many thanks to my professor Dana for answering all my annoying questions.
